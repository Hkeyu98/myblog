 Hi there,

 I'm Hazel. **Here I am in London!**

 I have a background of *BA International Media and Communications Studies* with the second foreign language of French.

 I'm fascinated with the impact that digital technologies would bring to humanities courses.

### My top 5 museums and galleries ###
1. [Tate Modern]("https://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern")

3. [V&A]("https://www.vam.ac.uk")
