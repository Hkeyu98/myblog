 Hi there,

 I'm Hazel. **Here I am in London!**

 I have a background of *BA International Media and Communications Studies* with the second foreign language of French.

 I'm fascinated with the impact that digital technologies would bring to humanities courses.

### My top 5 museums and galleries ###
1. [Tate Modern]("https://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern")

   > My fav ever since my first visit in London. I love its curations dedicated to modern arts that are usually delicate interpretations to modern motifs utilising audio-visual contents.

2. [The Met]("https://www.metmuseum.org")
    > From my sis's recommendation! 
3. [V&A]("https://www.vam.ac.uk")
    > Remarkable souvenir shop. And I am soo in love with the ideas of exhibition curating in V&S.
4. [Shanghai Science and Technology Museum]("http://www.sstm.org.cn/")
    > My childhood dreamland! I can spend a whole summer visiting it everyday since there are abundant choices of huge screen documentaries.
5. [H.R.Giger Museum]("https://www.hrgigermuseum.com/index2.php?option=gallery")
    > No need to mention. Giger was my favourite design artist that have connection with movie industry.
