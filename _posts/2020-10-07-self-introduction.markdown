##Getting to know about me##
Hi there,
I'm Hazel. **Here I am in London!**
I have a background of *BA International Media and Communications Studies* with the second foreign language of French.
I'm fascinated with the impact that digital technologies would bring to humanities courses. 
**Tate Modern** is my fav ever since my first visit in London. I love its curations dedicated to modern arts that are usually delicate interpretations to modern motifs utilising audio-visual contents.
