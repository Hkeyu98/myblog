The ***Eyptian Exhibition*** amazed me a lot. The Egyptian history has always been my fav section in my popular science readings since my childhood -- through my imagination based on the pictures, when I'm still away from the UK. But know, we can see it in 3D version thanks to British Museum's association with Sketchfab.

I consider that the ***3D scanning & exhibition*** is one of digital technologies that bring huge difference to the experience of visiting museums. The old type of scanning usually ignore the importance of material properties to an exhibits such as textiles and stokes, whilst 3D scanning could give me some ideas.
